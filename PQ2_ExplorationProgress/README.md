# Map Trix 2.2.0
better map tools for Civilization VII

## spot important map details
Map Trix shows you what you're pointing at:

- geography
- cities and towns
- buildings, improvements, and wonders
- resources and yields
- units present

## geography
the top of the tooltip describes the land, with emphasis on hazards and
obstacles.  color highlights warn you of fortifications, damaging
effects, and terrain features that can stop your movement.

## settlements
see which settlement claims each tile, who owns it, and their atttitude
toward you.  enemy territory appears in red.

## buildings
everything constructible goes here: buildings, improvements, and
wonders.  unique quarters and wonders show their special abilities.
buildings show their yield types as colored rings around the building
icons:  **green** for food, **yellow** for gold, and so on.  ageless and
current-age buildings have glowing rings.

## improvements
unimproved tiles show which basic improvement type the land supports,
and resources show which improvements unlock them.  unique improvements
show which basic improvement they replaced (for warehouse bonuses).

## population
a small table shows the local population of each district and rural
improvement.  verbose mode lists the full population and their religious
beliefs.  standard mode only shows specialist workers.

## yields
the last column shows the total of all yields under a bronze hexagon.

## compact or verbose
hold down Ctrl or Shift to change the level of detail, or Ctrl+Shift
together to hide the tooltip.  you can also set your preferred level in
the Options menu.

- compact: Ctrl
- verbose: Shift
- hidden: Ctrl+Shift

## compatibility with other mods
known interactions:

- **Sukritact's Simple UI Adjustments: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, the Map Trix tooltip replaces Sukritact's version.
- **zhekoff's Colorful Top Panel: compatible.**  when both mods are
  installed, Map Trix will restyle the top banner by default.  you can
  change that by turning off "restyle yield banner" in the Mods tab of
  the Options screen.
- **TCS Improved Plot Tooltip: incompatible.**  both mods enhance the
  same feature in different ways.
